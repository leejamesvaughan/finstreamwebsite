Hello! :)

Website is almost finished. I just need help with 2 small things...

1. I've got a modal popup which activates when clicking on the button 'Try for free'. But, this only works on the
very first button on the wesbite. I just need the button in the sticky nav to also activate the same modal popup, as well
as the buttons in the pricing table and also the Call to Action at the end of the website "Better customer relationships 
start today"

2. I've got a sticky nav below the fold. I've got text links in the nav. Can we make each of these links active (.active)
when the user scrolls to each of those sections? So just to clarify, when the user scrolls to "Frequently Asked Questions"
the FAQ text link in the sticky nav should turn blue.

The specific anchor points are listed below...

1. How  =  <section id="howitworks">
2. Brand it  =  <section id="brand">
3. Features. =  <section id="selfbookappointments"> 
4. Pricing  =  <section id="pricing">
5. F.A.Q  =  <section class="section" id="faq">
6. Why Finstream  =  <section class="section" id="benefits">
